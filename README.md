# Resume & Job Description Matcher (using Gemini & Embeddings) üìÑ‚û°Ô∏èüéØ

This Streamlit application helps users analyze how well a resume matches a given job description using both semantic similarity scores and detailed AI-powered analysis from Google's Gemini model. It also provides AI-driven suggestions for improving the resume content.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **üìÑ PDF Resume Parsing:** Upload your resume in PDF format for text extraction (using PyMuPDF).
*   **üìù Job Description Input:** Provide a job description either by pasting the text directly or entering a URL (uses newspaper3k for URL parsing).
*   **üìä Semantic Similarity Score:** Calculates a cosine similarity score (0-100%) between the resume and JD text using Sentence Transformers (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) embeddings to gauge overall semantic relevance.
*   **ü§ñ Detailed AI Matching Analysis (Gemini):** Leverages Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro model (`gemini-1.5-pro-latest`) to provide:
    *   A **Match Score** (out of 100).
    *   A concise **Explanation** justifying the score.
    *   A list of **Missing Factors** (keywords, skills, qualifications) from the resume compared to the JD.
*   **üí° AI Resume Improvement Suggestions (Gemini):** Offers suggestions generated by Gemini on how to enhance the uploaded resume content based on general best practices.

## üß† GenAI Capabilities Demonstrated (Kaggle Capstone)

This project demonstrates the following Generative AI capabilities:

1.  **Document Understanding:** Parsing text from PDF resumes (`PyMuPDF`) and web URLs (`newspaper3k`), and comprehension of resume/JD content by the LLM (Gemini 1.5 Pro).
2.  **Embeddings:** Utilizing Sentence Transformers (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) to generate semantic vector embeddings for resumes and job descriptions to calculate a similarity score.
3.  **Structured Output / Controlled Generation:** Instructing the Gemini LLM via specific prompt formatting to return the matching analysis (Score, Explanation, Missing Factors) in a predefined structure.
4.  **Few-shot Prompting (via Detailed Instructions):** Employing detailed, context-rich prompts that define the LLM's persona (e.g., "expert talent acquisition specialist"), task, constraints, and output format to guide its generation effectively for both matching and resume improvement.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/KRBharat-DS/Resume_JD_Matcher.git
    cd Resume_JD_Matcher
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate Conda Environment:** (Recommended)
    ```bash
    conda create --name resume_agent python=3.10 -y
    conda activate resume_agent
    ```
    *(Alternatively, use `python -m venv venv` and `source venv/bin/activate` or `venv\Scripts\activate`)*

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: `newspaper3k` might require NLTK data. If you encounter errors related to 'punkt', run `pip install nltk` and then `python -m nltk.downloader punkt`)*

4.  **Set Up Environment Variables:**
    *   Create a file named `.env` in the project's root directory (`Resume_JD_Matcher/`).
    *   Add your Google Generative AI API key to this file. You can get an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey). Ensure the "Generative Language API" is enabled in your associated Google Cloud project if necessary.
    *   The content of the `.env` file should be exactly:
        ```dotenv
        GEMAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
        ```
        *(Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual key. **Do NOT use quotes** around the key value.)*
    *   The `.gitignore` file is configured to prevent committing your `.env` file.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

1.  **Activate Environment:** Make sure your conda environment is active:
    ```bash
    conda activate resume_agent
    ```

2.  **Run the Streamlit App:**
    *   **Recommended (to avoid potential runtime errors):**
        ```bash
        streamlit run streamlit_app.py --server.fileWatcherType none
        ```
        *(The `--server.fileWatcherType none` flag disables Streamlit's file watcher, which can sometimes conflict with the `torch` library used by Sentence Transformers, causing runtime errors or a blank page.)*
    *   **Alternative (if the above works without the flag):**
        ```bash
        streamlit run streamlit_app.py
        ```

3.  **Use the App:** Open the URL provided by Streamlit (usually `http://localhost:8501`) in your web browser.
    *   Upload a resume PDF.
    *   Enter a job description URL or paste the text.
    *   Click the "Analyze Resume-JD Match" button to see the similarity score and Gemini's analysis.
    *   Click the "Suggest Resume Improvements" button (after uploading a resume) to get AI feedback.

## üöÄ Helper Script (`app.bat` for Windows)

*   An `app.bat` file is included for convenience on Windows.
*   It attempts to activate the `resume_agent` conda environment and run the Streamlit app with the `--server.fileWatcherType none` flag.
*   **Note:** The automatic conda activation within the batch file might not work depending on your system's PATH configuration. If it fails, activate the environment manually in your terminal (`conda activate resume_agent`) *before* running `app.bat`.
